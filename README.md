# Hackathon2015: FriendZone

## Idea:

Create an android application that would allow users to find friends on a GPS in real time, because let's face it, if we meet in a big place, it 
can be pretty hard to find your friend.

This would allow for friends (who have added each other on the application) to locate their friends and track their location, with permission
from the friend being tracked.

## Idea of Main Features:

- Add friends
- Request permission to see friend's location
- Show your location and friend's location on a GPS
- Update location in real time
